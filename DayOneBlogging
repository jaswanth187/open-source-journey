So today is offically Day 1 blogging of my journey towards the open source. so the motivation to start the open source is to get the remote job.
which obviously gives you high pay but also help you in growing in community. I got motivation from the youtuber called kunal kushwaha.
he is so good at it. I have started from tihs repository "https://github.com/WeMakeDevs/roadmaps/tree/main/Open-Source" i went through
almost half of the links in 2 to 3 days. because i already little knowledge about the open source, that is why it's offically day 1 but 
unoffically it isn't. and other thing that i want to mention is that i can blog this in a website but i want the explore the github 
features in blogging in github and also it is time consuming to build a website. i am still exploring the links and learning it might
take another 2 or 3 days to get started and i also made my first contribution using those steps mentioned. which is pretty such simple.
so plan is to hands on experience as soon as possible.
